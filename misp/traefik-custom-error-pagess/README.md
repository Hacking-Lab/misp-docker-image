# ⚠️ DEPRECATION WARNING ⚠️

I'm not using this image anymore. I switched from Traefik to [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) because Traefik is far too complicated for **my** needs. This image works as it. If you want new features, feel free to fork the project. An alternative project for the traefik error pages is [tarampampam/error-pages](https://github.com/tarampampam/error-pages).

# Custom error pages for Traefik

A bunch of custom error pages for Traefik built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

## Development

Install dependencies

```bash
$ bundle install
```

If you want to build the project on your host:

```bash
$ jekyll build
```

If you want to preview the pages before building the Docker image :

```bash
$ jekyll serve
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:4000/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/).

## How to use with Traefik and Docker in Production

Run the container with labels, **change with your needs**:

```yml
# docker-compose.yml

errorpage:
  image: guillaumebriday/traefik-custom-error-pages
  restart: unless-stopped
  networks:
    - web
  labels:
    - traefik.enable: "true"
    - traefik.docker.network: "web"
    - traefik.http.routers.errorpage.entrypoints: "websecure"
    - traefik.http.routers.errorpage.rule: "HostRegexp(`{host:.+}`)"
    - traefik.http.services.globalerrorpage.loadbalancer.server.port: "80"
```

## Build the image

This is a [multi-stage build](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/), to build the final image:

```bash
$ docker build -f .cloud/docker/Dockerfile -t traefik-custom-error-pages .
```

## How it works?

As you can see in the Dockerfile, I use [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) as Web server to serve static files. To generate this pages, I use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) in the first step of the build.

You will find in this article [https://www.techjunktrunk.com/docker/2017/11/03/traefik-default-server-catch-all](https://www.techjunktrunk.com/docker/2017/11/03/traefik-default-server-catch-all/) why I set up `rule` this way.

It's very useful because this container will respond to all requests only if there is no container with a real rule.

## Credits

I used the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) default HTTP error pages.
